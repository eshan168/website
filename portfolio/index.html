                Also able to be played with two people using wasd and the arrow keys. The 
                AI predicts where the ball is going to land vertically on the other side and 
                moves the paddle in time to hit it. It was made using python tkinter.

                This is also able to be played with two people by just clicking the boxes
                during your turn. When the space bar is clicked, using the minimax algorithm,
                the AI will play the move with the best end result for whoevers turn it is.
                The gui was also made using python tkinter.

                The program calculates each of the bodies gravitational acceleration on each
                other then adjusts their vectors and then moves them based on the time step each
                frame and follows that step with a trail. It is already progrmamed with a scale
                model of the solar system with every pixel being one million kilometers and all 
                the calculations are and vectors are to scale. There is also a sidebar in the gui
                to add, modify, and delete bodies and to change the focus of the simulation.
                This was also made in python tkinter.

                A very simple website with a calculator and weather tab. The calculator has a four
                by four keypad with only basic operations and a clear and equals button and the
                weather app using a geocoder api to get the latitude and longitude of an address
                and then uses those coordinates to get the temperature from a weather api. Made
                only using html css and javascript.
